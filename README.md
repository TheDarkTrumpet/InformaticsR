# InformaticsR

On 4/23/2016 - the Informatics Showcase http://www.uiowa.edu/informaticsshowcase/ was held at the University of Iowa.  Of the two sessions I went to, Introduction to R and visualization, I decided to upload the code from the presentations, including my own work and mucking about with the data.

## File Structure
* RSeminarScript.R - This is the script/demo file provided by the Introduction to R course
* Visualization.R - This is my attempt to follow along with the course
* playground.R - This is my attempt to learn the language, using their information provided.
